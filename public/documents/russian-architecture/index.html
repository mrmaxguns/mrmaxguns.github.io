      Disclaimer: The Russian-Speaking School of Austin is a diverse community of Russian-speaking
      Austinites from all over the world. The school is not affiliated with the Russian Federation,
      nor does it support Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It is a cultural center which aims to teach
      child and adult students useful schools such as Russian language, theater, and in my case, architecture.

      If you live in Austin and are interested, you can find the info on
      <a href="https://russianschoolofaustin.org/">the school's official website.</a>

    <h2>The problem</h2>
    <p>
      The <a href="https://russianschoolofaustin.org/">Russian-Speaking School of Austin</a>
      is currently renting facilities at the
      <a href="https://osm.org/go/Ts0uz_rp~?m=">Northwest Hills United Methodist Church</a>.
      Ideally, the school would have its own location to function. This presents less
      friction and scheduling conflicts, as well as allowing the school to have full control
      over its educational facilities. It is a Sunday school that offers a lot of different
      subjects, so that presents additional difficulties. A possible approach would be owining
      the building, while renting it out: the school happens on Sundays, and leases its facilities
      out to other organizations over the course of the week.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our idea at the Russian-Speaking School of Austin architecture class was to create a
      design that could accomplish this goal. This page showcases every step
      that I took over the course of three years to bring this project to fruition.
      We went all the way from paper to a suitable 3D model. While this design is
      far from official, it could serve as the starting point for a development
      project in the future.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <p>
      The new school building would have to follow a number of important criteria.
      These arise primarily due to the unique nature of the Russian school: it is a Sunday
      school with a very small class size and diverse set of activities, requiring
      multifunctional facilities for student and faculty use. For any minimal project,
      the following requirements would have to be met:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>12 general-purpose classrooms</li>
      <li>A theater with a stage and seating</li>
      <li>A multifunctional facility that could function as a sports center</li>
      <li>Common areas which could function as gathering points for school activities</li>
      <li>Main facilities are completely wheelchair accessible</li>
      <li>Greenery and good use of light in the hot Texas environment</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The end result must be sufficiently small, yet extremely versatile. The
      focus on multimodality would fully accommodate all the classes
      that happen on campus from theater arts to karate.
    </p>

    <h2>Idea sketches</h2>
    <p>
      I started by sketching the school from different angles. Sergey (my mentor) and I went through a
      ton of different ideas. There were all sorts of designs that had their own advantages
      and flaws. It all starts with a scribble on the paper, which functions as the seed
      from which a project can be grown. These sketches are the brainstorming process that allows
      for new ideas to come to mind.
    </p>
    <p>(This is a placeholder. Unfortunately I haven't got around to scanning them yet.)</p>
    <p>
      Eventually, we settled on a two-story design with a central courtyard. This allows
      students to walk easily between classes and be able to rest in the courtyard. The
      courtyard serves as a focal point for school-wide events. Additional facilities
      are placed outside this core part of the school.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Initial drafts</h2>
    <p>
      With the basic idea in place, I proceeded to draft floor plans and elevations. The
      school building itself is simplistic and functional. Large square windows provide
      natural light into every classroom. The courtyard is lit from a glass roof in the
      top.

    <h2>Mockup</h2>
    <p>
      We proceeded to make an initial concrete version design using cardboard. This is
      a highly effective way to visualize the design without using CAD software. The
      approach allows for the model to be viewed and touched, something that digital
      images don't provide. This step is important especially when showcasing the
      design to others, since laymen are not always comfortable with reading 2D architectural
      drawings.
    </p>

      <span class="marginnote">A cardboard model is a good way to showcase a project in a cheap and aesthetically pleasing manner.</span>
      <img src="images/model-overview.jpg" alt="a cardboard mockup of a school sitting on top of gravel, featuring colorful elements and intricate details">
    </figure>
    <p>
      The front entrance of the school is attached to a foyer area that is large and spans
      two stories. The rounded entrance is made of glass panels, which allows for a connection
      to the outside world. In Texas, these windows are usually coated in a material that
      provides shade to occupants within the building. A similar method could be used in this
      case. The entrance is surrounded by two opposing trapezoidal forms that break the
      symmetry that the rest of the building exhibits.
    </p>
    <p>
      An interesting part of the process was photographing in different locations and playing
      around with natural objects to enhance the realism of the model. Sergey found some
      twigs on the ground that we attached to the model. They look like little trees and
      help the viewer imagine the model's scale. Most photographs were taken at the
      Northwest Hills United Methodist Church and Murchison Middle School in Austin, Texas.

      <label for="mn-model-back" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
      <input type="checkbox" id="mn-model-back" class="margin-toggle"/>
      <span class="marginnote">I played around quite a bit with scrap pieces of cardboard. The colorful features break what would otherwise be a dull, institutional environment.</span>
      <img src="images/model-back.jpg" alt="the back of the cardboard mockup is positioned in front of the imposing church building and features red-orange geometric compositional elements">
    </figure>
    <p>
      I decided to adorn the building with bright red geometric elements. While the classrooms
      themselves are meant to be standard and symmetric, this institutional feel is broken
      by the exterior adornments. These triangles, rectangles, and trapezoids make the building
      stand out in its natural environment. I am very satisfied with how the exterior design
      of the mockup turned out.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <label for="mn-model-roof" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>

      <span class="marginnote">The curved roof is a key component that utilizes natural lighting. The roof continues from one end to another uninterrupted.</span>
      <img src="images/model-roof.jpg" alt="the cardboard mockup is on a grassy field with the arc-shaped roof and second-story classrooms visible from above">
    </figure>
    <p>
      A big part of the design is the roof that covers the courtyard at the heart of the school. I
      experimented with different roof shapes, including sloped, covered, and triangular. In the end,
      for the mockup we used a arched glass roof which is extended in the front by a solid shade roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the back of the building is the theater, whose roof is also a continuation of the arc shape.
      The round room is the library, while the angled room across from the library is the gym. I decided that
      while the classrooms can be standardized, I can afford to make the school's other multifunctional spaces different.
      Additionally, the classrooms occupy only one story each, while the multifunctional areas occupy both
      stories.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <label for="mn-model-floors" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
      <input type="checkbox" id="mn-model-floors" class="margin-toggle"/>
      <span class="marginnote">Through clever craftsmanship, the roof slides cleanly on and off the main building.</span>
      <img src="images/model-floors.jpg" alt="the main school building lays separate from the second story on a grassy field, allowing visibility of the inner courtyard and first story">
    </figure>
    <p>
      I carefully made the model so that the second story isn't actually attached to the first. This allows
      it to be removed so that one can peer in and see the bottom story and courtyard floor. During the process
      I accidentally glued them together a couple times and needed to remove them with a utility knife. I am thankful
      that Sergey is patient and walked me, a rookie, through the process of cardboard modeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creating structures from cardboard is actually a really awesome experience. All you need is cardboard/paper,
      a utility (X-Acto) knife, and liquid school glue (yes, really, Elmer's school glue will do!). The process is
      simple, but requires patience. First, you squirt a tiny amount of glue onto your finger. Next, you rub your
      finger smoothly along the surface that needs to be glued. Afterward, you quickly attach the two surfaces that
      need to be glued and hold them together for 30 seconds to a minute. You can then let go: the glue will magically
      harden and become invisible over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the cardboard itself, I cut it all using a utility knife over a cutting mat. The key for cutting cardboard
      is to run the knife over the cut multiple times, cutting through a layer each time. This is time-consuming work
      that is tempting to rush. As I learned, rushing produces poor, jagged cuts, which do not look good on such a small
      and intricate model.
    </p>
    <p>
      As is the case with most crafts: think before you act. Measure twice, cut once.<label for="sn-measure-twice" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-measure-twice" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Or, as the Russian saying goes, <em>measure seven times, cut off once</em> (семь раз отмерь, один отрежь)</span>
      I could have saved myself a nasty utility knife cut if I were more careful and patient.

      <img src="images/model-composition.jpg" alt="the cardboard model stands on a concrete sidewalk in front of a modern church building blurred in the background">
    </figure>
    <p>
      An exciting step after I created the cardboard model was photographing it. Sergey and I took it to many places
      around the church and nearby school. We took shots from different angles, at different distances, and with different
      backdrops. The camera itself is a powerful tools to create optical illusions and interesting compositions. I also
      played around in <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a> to paste the school into photos I have taken. They don't look
      photorealistic, but are detailed enough that they provide a good overview about my vision as an architect.
    </p>

      <input type="checkbox" id="mn-edit1" class="margin-toggle"/>

      <input type="checkbox" id="mn-edit2" class="margin-toggle"/>
      <span class="marginnote">An important part of the process was making sure that the perspective of the model photo matches the perspective of the backdrop.</span>

      <input type="checkbox" id="mn-edit3" class="margin-toggle"/>

      <img src="images/edit3.jpg" alt="a photoshopped image of the cardboard model standing to scale on the left of a real parking lot">
    </figure>
    <p>
      After countless hours on the model, it turned way better than I had ever anticipated. Upon
      close inspection you can see the wiggly cuts, uneven shapes, and imperfect gluing. However,
      the model meets all the requirements and accurately portrays my vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I talk about myself doing things, the whole time I have a teacher there at my side willing to help.
      After getting a doctorate in architecture in Moscow, Sergey worked as a professor in Mexico,
      teaching first year architecture students like myself how to make similar structures. Craftsmanship
      is something that may be overlooked in the age of AutoCAD and Revit, but it is an important step
      in any architect's journey. I am grateful to have been mentored by a knowledgeable architect
      like Sergey.

    <h2>3D model</h2>
    <p>
      The final stage of my process involved a lot of experimentation. A digital representation of a building
      is a key feature of any modern architectural project. Unfortunately, what you can and can't do in this
      stage heavily depends on what software you have available. Architectural design software is highly complex:
      it has to be simple enough to not be a burden, yet also allow for extremely flexible and unique designs.
      This step in my journey was full of ups and downs, and unlike in previous steps, I had to rely a lot on online
      forums and trial and error to get things accomplished.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first program that I attempted to use was <a href="https://www.freecad.org/">FreeCAD</a>. FreeCAD is one
      of the most complex and feature-rich multipurpose CAD (Computer Aided Design) solutions available as
      <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">free/libre software</a>. It comes at no cost and
      development is done by volunteers. This makes very versatile and community-driven. I have used FreeCAD before
      to make small 3D-printable models and it did the job, but I had never tried its architectural features.
    </p>
    <p>
      Architectural plans in the 21st century are developed using BIM (Building Information Modeling) software. A BIM
      program is a tool that architects and drafters use to create a digital representation of a real-life
      site, such as the school that I am making. FreeCAD comes with a separate BIM workbench which has tools
      such as walls, doors, and windows. However, what counts as a "wall" or "window" to the program is irrelevant &ndash;
      it only knows when I mark objects as such.
      This allows me to create custom wall shapes using FreeCAD's modeling tools and then mark them by their
      type accordingly. This grants me a great deal of flexibility when designing a pretty intricate building like
      the school.
    </p>
    <figure class="fullwidth">
      <img src="images/freecad.png" alt="a screenshot of the FreeCAD application open in the BIM workbench and displaying the grey outline of a loosely modeled school building">
    </figure>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, what you see in the image is as far as I got before giving up on FreeCAD. As a firm believer
      in the importance of free software,<label for="sn-free-software" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-free-software" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Free as in freedom, rather than cost. <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">This article explains the distinction well.</a></span>
      I tried <em>really</em> hard to model the building despite FreeCAD's quirks. I ran into a number of issues
      when trying to make the building. In particular, every step felt tedious and it was as if I was fighting
      the program to get things done. I came across issues with ensuring proper distances between various components,
      since moving and properly positioning things is difficult. Additionally, the lack of features such as proper mirroring
      (the windows are basically the same on both sides of the building) made the process slower than it needed to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      That being said, I am extremely grateful for the FreeCAD team for constantly pushing out improvements.
      I understand that this is free software, and that I have absolutely no right to complain. I am just pointing
      out some issues that made it difficult for me to use FreeCAD for this type of project. Still, I am amazed
      by the amount of features that have already been implemented. I highly recommend checking out FreeCAD developer
      <a href="http://yorik.uncreated.net/">Yorik van Havre's blog</a> in order to understand his motivations
      and processes behind developing the BIM workbench.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the first model abandoned, I searched for another program that would be capable of getting things
      done. To my surprise, another libre program exists that solved many of my needs:
      <a href="https://www.sweethome3d.com/">Sweet Home 3D</a>. This application is mainly aimed at interior
      design for people looking to solidify their vision for a dream home. I knew right from the onset that
      it wasn't designed with the technical architect in mind, but figured that I might as well try.
    </p>
    <figure class="fullwidth">
      <img src="images/sh3d.png" alt="a screenshot of Sweet Home 3D open, with one window showing a floor plan, and another open showing a 3D view of the school from above">
    </figure>
    <p>
      I was very surprised by the versatility of Sweet Home 3D. The simplicity of the interface allowed me to
      get things done very quickly. I especially loved the distance guiding feature when inserting objects, allowing
      me to precisely place things in a fast manner. Despite the program not being made for my use case, I got most
      of my vision transferred onto the canvas. Unfortunately, the program doesn't have the concept of architectural
      elements like columns. While one can import any 3D model, the lack of parametrization features essentially
      means that the 3D model must be custom-made for the building at hand. This, combined with the lack of features
      like an easy way to create roofs, limits this program to hobbyist use cases. Once again, I greatly appreciate
      the work that the community has put in to make this piece of software possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would have wrapped the project up here had I not learned from fellow architecture guru Nelly Bogner that Autodesk
      provides its whole software catalog for free to students (ranging from primary school to university). Going to the
      <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/education/gateway?sorting=featured&filters=individual">Autodesk education gateway</a>
      an uploading a copy of my transcript gave me access to the whole suite of Autodesk programs, including AutoCAD
      and Revit, two industry standard programs for architectural drafting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given that Revit has gained significant traction in the architecture world, I decided to use the program to model
      the school once again. Luckily, I had a whole week of spring break to figure out how to use the program. To my
      surprise, I ran into little friction and managed to get most of the work done over that week. Being a more mature
      proprietary program, Revit has a lot of features that make building things easier. While it isn't perfect, I was
      able to get almost everything that I envisioned for the school into the model.
    </p>
    <figure class="fullwidth">
      <img src="images/revit.png" alt="a screenshot of Autodesk Revit open, with one window showing a detailed floorplan, and another showing a colored 3D view of the school">
    </figure>
    <p>
      To me, Revit was easy to learn. I mostly relied on the official documentation when looking for help. There
      are a series of short official tutorial videos that I found helpful when starting out. While the building is extremely detailed,
      it is by no means a final draft from which something can be built. I didn't model the electrical elements, pipes,
      and other necessary features required by building code. These elements rely on engineering knowledge and building
      codes, things that were not of interest to me for this project.
    </p>

    <h2>Final results: an exploration of architectural choices</h2>
    <p>
      As you may have noticed, with every iteration I made changes to the school's design. Switching to a new medium
      allowed for Sergey and I to tweak things and add new details. The model in Revit is by far the most fully-featured.
      I spent all spring 2024 adjusting the model and working things out.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <label for="mn-plan-level1" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
      <input type="checkbox" id="mn-plan-level1" class="margin-toggle"/>
      <span class="marginnote">Architectural drawing of the school's first (ground) level.</span>
      <img src="images/plan-level1.jpg" alt="a black-and-white computer generated architectural drawing of the school's ground floor plan">
    </figure>
    <p>
      Throughout my iterations, the courtyard-centered design remained mostly unchanged. There are still
      twelve main classrooms, with 6 on each level. The entrance is flanked by two rooms: the conference room
      on the left and office on the right. In this iteration they are round and symmetrical. My main idea of
      having the core educational facility be standard, while other rooms are more "out-of-the-box" in terms
      of shape and exterior features, remained consistent in this design.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <label for="mn-plan-level2" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
      <input type="checkbox" id="mn-plan-level2" class="margin-toggle"/>
      <span class="marginnote">The school's second level is much like the first. Notice that large, multifunctional rooms like the library, theater, and gym, have ceilings aligned with the second floor ceilings.</span>
      <img src="images/plan-level2.jpg" alt="a black-and-white computer generated architectural drawing of the school's second floor plan">
    </figure>
    <p>
      The courtyard transitions smoothly into a lobby that enters the theater. The lobby was introduced in the Revit
      design to provide yet another space for people to gather for various events. The gym on the west side of the building
      is nonstandard. Normally, this would present an issue for a public school which has a "professional" team. However,
      because this is a Sunday school, the main function for the gym is unstructured athletic activity. The round room on the
      east side opposite the gym is the library. Just like the gym, it extends two stories in height. Notice how the
      shelves continue the angle set up by the gym wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Revit model of the school is heavily influenced
      by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deconstructivism">deconstructivism</a>. Notice the angle at which the
      gym's north wall is at. If you were to draw an imaginary line from the gym, you'd be tangent to the circular wall
      of the library. I decided to play around with breaking the standard parallel-perpendicular construction by including
      an additional axis to which parts of the building are aligned. Notice also the fountain in the courtyard and the
      concrete foundation slab which the building stands on &ndash; they form a part of this deconstructivist reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      A big change that I made in the latest design is the introduction of an outdoor amphitheater, extending
      the inner stage with a complementary outdoor stage. On sunny days, the outdoor stage can be used for
      large-scale community events. In the case of rain, things can be moved quickly to the corresponding indoor
      stage through the large central folding door. To the left and right of the stage are areas for performers
      and props. There is also a storage area adjacent to the southeast end of the indoor theater.
    </p>

    </figure>
    <p>
      The school's entrance is a multistory glass curtain wall. The design continues upward in the triangular
      glass roof that goes across the courtyard. To the left and right you can see the office and conference
      room on the first floor. The second floor has two small open viewing areas that you can see through the
      second floor windows.

      Finally, I decided that the best way to present my design to others would be through 3D renderings.
      Architectural drawings are hard to quickly comprehend for laymen. With the power of modern architectural
      software, creating rich renderings is easy. As a student, I also had access to unlimited cloud rendering
      by Autodesk.

        This walkthrough is fast-paced because I had to render each frame on my Windows laptop. One area
        where Revit struggles is creating walkthroughs, since adding points afterwards is tedious and error-prone.
        I used <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/">FFmpeg</a> to join the frames together into a video.

      Playing with different rendering options and angles was very interesting. I put in some furniture
      and landscaping details to bring the building to life. The Autodesk built-in library has most important
      building components. For some select items such as the fountain, I found them pretty easily online.
      Many companies that sell construction-related products have free Revit families on their websites
      which you can download.

    <p>
      Apart from the sloped roof, the rest of the roofs are flat and surrounded by parapets. In reality,
      the roof would be slightly tilted so that water would flow into drainage pipes when it rains. I did
      not model this complexity, but it was fascinating to know that it exists and has to be taken care
      of. Even a project as simple as a house requires tons of planning and the expertise from multiple
      people working in conjunction.

      <input type="checkbox" id="mn-render-foyer" class="margin-toggle"/>
      <span class="marginnote">The foyer is the central entrypoint for students, teachers, and guests. It opens up to the courtyard and hallways on either side, as well as the office and conference room.</span>

    </details>
    <p>
      The foyer is meant to be welcoming and serve as a central connector to the rest of the school's
      rooms. It may have a reception area, which can be set up in front of the main office entrance.
      Whether a student goes to the right or to the left, they'll be able to take a staircase up to
      the second floor. The two staircases intersect and allow for traffic to pass freely between
      floors. The school also has an elevator, which can be found to the right of the theater
      foyer (you can see it to the right of the fountain in the image above).

    <p>
      The courtyard is a multifunctional area at the heart of the school. Above it is a glass roof through which
      you can see the sky. The school's main halls go around the courtyard. The second floor hallway is identical
      to the one on the first floor, which allows students to peer down onto the courtyard from above. The fountain,
      benches, and trees create a park-like relaxing atmosphere. Behind the courtyard is a foyer area which provides
      access to the theater.

    </figure>
    <p>
      As a theater kid myself, I put a lot of importance on this part of the school. In fact, the school building has
      two stages which sit back-to-back. The inner theater stage has a large white foldable door (which you can see
      in the image above) which connects to the outer stage. This allows for performances to happen both inside and out
      in fresh air. On the left and right are two actors' rooms that have exits onto the stage. While the stage in
      the Revit design is plain, it could be extended to be a fully-featured theatrical stage if need be. For example,
      a curtain could be hung near the back to allow actors to pass from one side to the other.

      <span class="marginnote">The exterior amphitheater is something that you won't find in many schools. Don't mind the creepy floating office lady &ndash; when I was putting in people, they all looked the same in the floor plan view, so I didn't even notice. I thought it would be funnier to just keep her there.</span>

    </details>
    <p>
      The door that you see in the middle of the amphitheater stage is the same one that's on the inner stage. The
      two stages are identical in size. The Russian school has many events that are held in open air. The amphitheater
      serves as another multipurpose facility that could accomplish this goal.

      <img src="images/render-library.jpg" alt="a rendering of the round-shaped library with a two-story brick wall, comfortable armchairs, and empty shelves">
    </figure>
    <p>
      The library is a large two-story facility that has ample space for bookshelves and seating. Throughout
      this project, I changed its shape multiple times. In the final Revit version, it is a single elegant
      arc that has large windows to let in light. It is meant to look grand, modern, and simple. I envision
      walking in and pulling out a work of Pushkin or Checkhov from the shelves before comfortably relaxing
      and reading it the natural light that seeps in from the windows.

      <label for="mn-render-side" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
      <input type="checkbox" id="mn-render-side" class="margin-toggle"/>
      <span class="marginnote">From the side, the school looks quite normal with classrooms and rectangular windows. Shades mess with the dynamics of light in interesting ways.</span>
      <img src="images/render-side.jpg" alt="rendering of the school's side wall with rows of rectangular classroom windows accentuated by decorative metal shades from above">
    </figure>
    <p>
      As I said before, the classrooms are meant to be standard for the sake of education. This part of the
      building is relatively simple and rectangular. Sergei and I played with ornamental elements such as shades.
      These provide protection from the sun, but also create interesting patterns of light that break up the building's
      monotony.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <label for="mn-render-classroom" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
      <input type="checkbox" id="mn-render-classroom" class="margin-toggle"/>
      <span class="marginnote">Nothing to see here. Just an ordinary classroom, albeit with large windows.</span>
      <img src="images/render-classroom.jpg" alt="rendering of a rectangular classroom with a shiny whiteboard and a grid of chairs connected to desks; large windows let in lots of external light">
    </figure>
    <p>
      Classrooms are perfectly square and have matching rows of rectangular windows broken up into
      squares. The shape of the room implies little of its function. This is mainly because the
      Russian school has a very diverse set of activities, from math to sculpture. Classrooms can
      be furnished and organized as needed. Two classrooms on the first floor have emergency exits
      directly outside. This enhances safety by allowing students and staff quick escape in the event of
      an emergency.

    </figure>
    <p>
      On a final note, I found lighting to be tedious, yet able to create very interesting results.
      It took a lot of tweaking before day and night lighting both looked fine. In the image above
      you can see various light fixtures that I attached. Panel lights, arena lights, and street lights
      all helped make the building look more realistic during the day and night.
    </p>
    <p>
      I really enjoyed working with Revit to make my vision a reality. I have many complaints about
      the software, but overall the experience was smooth and I made a lot of progress in the past
      two months. I went from not knowing anything about the program to being proficient in basic
      tasks (enough to build the result you see now) in a couple of weeks. It's really cool that Autodesk
      lets students access their super expensive stuff for free. I talked to an architect who told me
      that even her work Autodesk account had limits on what she could build, whereas students get no
      limits whatsoever. If you're interested in architectural design, I recommend checking all of
      these programs out.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      This June marks a bittersweet end to my Russian school project. Who knows? Perhaps, I will live
      to see the day that this is built. I learned many narrow and broad things about architecture, art,
      technology, and handcraft. A vital thing that I've learned is that it's important to have a
      grasp on what it means for a building to exist in reality. The complexity of modern-day constructions
      is impressive, but it all starts with a paper and pencil. Yes, you can jump straight into 3D programs,
      but you won't have the spacial awareness that you get by drawing and building physical models. Doing
      a project in stages allows you to move on from less to more complex, while experimenting and making
      changes along the way. This process is extremely valuable and allows you to intentionally make
      each single decision about the final result.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Sergei taught me, an architect's job is to create a spacial environment in which social and functional
      processes take place. In my case, that was a school. I would say that I successfully accomplished this mission.
      Right now, it's simply some papers, a mockup, a set of 1s and 0s on a computer. Yet this "paper architecture"
      is the essence of what it means to be an architect. It is a vision from which stems an actual construction.
      It all starts with a thought that evolves into something greater. Ultimately, the tangible building is
      the application of this powerful idea in reality.

    <h2>Credits</h2>
    <p>
      Thanks for stopping by and learning about my project. I would like to thank Sergei Yudin, who
      patiently and wisely guided me through my architectural journey. Without him, none of this would
      be possible. He brought reason and truth to my learning process, and his teaching is what made
      me capable of picking up a pencil and conjuring up a building in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, I would like to thank Nelly Bogner. She was the person who informed me that
      Revit is a thing that's accessible to me, and she helped me understand how to handle the
      unwieldy program. Her passion for architecture inspires me to continue creating.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, I am indebted to the Russian Speaking School of Austin for making the paper
      architecture class possible. I have come a long way thanks to the sage advice of many
      in that institution.
