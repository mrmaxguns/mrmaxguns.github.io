  <h1>My Journey in Architecture</h1>

  <p>This is my first blog post in a while. I have been busy these past years, and
have utterly neglected this website. Now that I have some time, I would like
to share a project that I have been working on for quite some time now.</p>
<p>As a student at the <a href="https://russianschoolofaustin.org">Russian-Speaking School of Austin</a>
architecture class, I embarked on a mission to create the school a new building,
since it currently rents rooms from a church.</p>
<p>I went from drawing possible variations, to creating a mockup, and ultimately
a complete 3D model for a building. I followed a lot of steps that architects
follow to make their vision into a reality. Maybe some day if there&rsquo;s funding,
this project could be built.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I wrote an extensive article on my creative process.
<a href="/documents/russian-architecture/">Click here to read the article</a> (warning,
there&rsquo;s a lot of images). I hope you enjoy!</p>
