A curated collection of documents I made or have rights to. If you are looking
for a certain topic, check out all the [tags associated with articles](/tags/).

-   A short lecture on binary data representation, bitwise operators, and bitboards
    ([html](bitwise-bitboards)/[pdf](bitwise-bitboards.pdf)). See the
    [lecture handout here](bitwise-bitboards-handout.pdf).
-   An architectural project for the Russian-Speaking School of Austin that I have
    been working on since 2021.
    [I wrote a detailed writeup that's accessible here](russian-architecture).
