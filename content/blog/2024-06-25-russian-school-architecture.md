This is my first blog post in a while. I have been busy these past years, and
have utterly neglected this website. Now that I have some time, I would like
to share a project that I have been working on for quite some time now.

As a student at the [Russian-Speaking School of Austin](https://russianschoolofaustin.org)
architecture class, I embarked on a mission to create the school a new building,
since it currently rents rooms from a church.

I went from drawing possible variations, to creating a mockup, and ultimately
a complete 3D model for a building. I followed a lot of steps that architects
follow to make their vision into a reality. Maybe some day if there's funding,
this project could be built.

In the meantime, I wrote an extensive article on my creative process.
[Click here to read the article](/documents/russian-architecture/) (warning,
there's a lot of images). I hope you enjoy!
