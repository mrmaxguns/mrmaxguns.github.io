      I like to work on what interets me. One week, I'm learning
      Numpy, the next I'm learning CSS animations. Some topics
      interest me more. I often spend weeks or months on those,
      applying them in real-world projects. My favorite
      language&mdash;Python allows me to experiment with various
      disciplines from machine learning to backend development.

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>
      In my free time I enjoy programming. I develop free software for
      everyone to use. Most of my programming projects are freely
      licensed and can be found on
      <a href="https://github.com/mrmaxguns">my GitHub page</a>. I
      find solving problems with computer programs exciting, and I
      also like to design software that can be put to use in the real
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am also interested in aviation. Although I don't have a
      private pilot's license (I'm too young to get one), I hope to
      obtain one and an instrument rating after that. For now, I fly
      on my favorite flight simulator, XPlane, and read books about
      the fascinating world of aviation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy both mountain biking and swimming. I have been mountain
      biking for over a year now and hope to continue learning new
      tricks and techniques.

        <h3>My Personal Website</h3>
        <p>
          What you're viewing right now is my personal website, a
          project that I constantly work on. Here you can find my blog
          and other documents that I've decided to publish. I decided
          to make it with Jekyll as it's natively supported by GitHub
          and I like the simplicity of the static site generator.
          Working on this project taught me a lot about HTML and CSS
          including how to make accessible websites and how to use the
          CSS flexbox model.

        <h3>Wonderwords</h3>
        <p>
          Wonderwords is a Python library for generating random words
          and sentences. Working on the project taught me a lot about
          creating and maintaining a Python library as well as an open
          source project. I plan to add new features and optimize it
          further.

        <h3>Dream Journal</h3>
        <p>
          Dream Journal is a Python dream journal web application
          meant to be self-hosted by its user. The app is made with
          the Python Flask library and is one of my first backend
          development projects. The app is no longer maintained, but
          serves as an example of my earlier development work.

        <h3>Please Readme</h3>
        <p>
          Please Readme is a command-line program to automatically
          generate READMEs. It is a relatively simple interactive
          program and was one of my first object-oriented programming
          projects. Although I haven't worked on it in a while, I have
          plans to rewrite the library and add many new features.
