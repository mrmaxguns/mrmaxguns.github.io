<p>
  My blog is a place where I write about various topics including
  programming, aviation, mathematics and other subjects that interest
  me. My goal is to write a post at least once every two weeks,
  although that depends on how busy I get.

<section>
  <h2>Latest posts</h2>
  {% for post in paginator.posts %}
  <article>
    <h3><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></h3>
    {{ post.excerpt }}
  </article>
  {% endfor %}
</section>


<div class="split-align global-footer">
  {% if paginator.previous_page %}
  <p>
    <a href="{{ paginator.previous_page_path }}">
      &#x3C; Newer posts
    </a>
  </p>
  {% else %}
  <p>No newer posts</p>
  {% endif %}
