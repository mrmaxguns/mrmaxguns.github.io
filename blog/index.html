  Blog

<p>
  My blog is a place where I write about various topics including
  programming, aviation, mathematics and other subjects that interest
  me. My goal is to write a post at least once every two weeks,
  although that depends on how busy I get.

    <h3><a href="/web/2021/08/12/accessible-html-elements/">Choosing the right element – accessible web design</a></h3>
    <p>Accessible design means creating software that can be used easily by
all users. This entails making sure that any user can easily interact
with an application, sometimes with the support of assistive
technology like screen readers. Focusing on accessibility is important
because people who are affected by blindness and other disabilities
will be able to interact with the application in a meaningful way.</p>

    <h3><a href="/meta/2021/08/11/hello-world/">Hello, World!</a></h3>
    <p>This is my first post! For the new blog redesign anyway. I decided to
remake my blog because I wanted my site to be unique to me. My design
goals were to make it minimal and clean, as it’s a blog, and blogs
should strive to emphasize the content. It’s still built using Jekyll,
and hosted on GitHub pages. However, now I have a custom theme. I’ve
written all the layouts and stylesheets from scratch.</p>
